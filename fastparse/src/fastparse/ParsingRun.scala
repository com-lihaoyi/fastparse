/**
  * Models an in-progress parsing run; contains all the mutable state that may
  * be necessary during the parse, in order to avoid the individual parsers
  * needing to perform their own allocations and instantiations, and greatly
  * improving performance
  *
  * There are a few patterns that let us program with these mutable variables
  * in a sort-of-pure-functional way:
  *
  test - If a parser that wishes to ignore changes to a field within their child
  *   parsers, a common pattern is to save the value of the field before the
  *   wrapped parser runs, and then re-set the field. e.g. this can be used to
  *   backtrack [[index]] after a lookahead parser finishes
  *
  test - If a parser wants to read the value of the field "returned" by multiple
  *   child parsers, make sure to read the field into a local variable after
  *   each child parser is complete to make sure the value you want from an
  *   earlier child isn't stomped over by a later child
  *
  *   In general, for a parser to "return" a value in a mutable field, it is
  *   sufficient to simply set the value of that field before returning. It
  *   is the parent-parser's responsibility to make sure it reads out the value
  *   of the field to a local variable before running another child parser that
  *   will over-write the mutable field
  *
  * @param input            The input to the parsing run, as a [[ParserInput]].
  * @param startIndex       Where the parse initially started, so as to allow
  *                         `.result.traced`  to re-create it with tracing enabled.
  * @param originalParser   The original parsing function we used to start this
  *                         run, so as to allow `.result.traced` to re-create
  *                         it with tracing enabled.
  * @param traceIndex       The index we wish to trace if tracing is enabled, else
  *                         -1. Used to find failure messages to aggregate into
  *                         `failureTerminalAggregate`
  * @param instrument       Callbacks that can be injected before/after every
  *                         `P(...)` parser.
  * @param failureTerminalAggregate When tracing is enabled, this collects up all the
  *                         upper-most failures that happen at [[traceIndex]]
  *                         (in [[Lazy]] wrappers) so they can be shown to the
  *                         user at end-of-parse as suggestions for what could
  *                         make the parse succeed. For terminal parsers like
  *                         [[LiteralStr]], it just aggregate's the string
  *                         representation. For composite parsers like `a ~ b`
  *                         or `!a` which may fail at [[traceIndex]] even
  *                         without any of their wrapped terminal parsers
  *                         failing there, it makes use of the
  *                         [[shortParserMsg]] as the string representation of
  *                         the composite parser.
  * @param shortParserMsg   When tracing is enabled, this contains string
  *                         representation of the last parser to run. Since
  *                         parsers aren't really objects, we piece together
  *                         the string in the parser body and return store it
  *                         here, and an enclosing parser may fetch it back
  *                         out to help build its own string representation.
  *                         If the last parser started before the `traceIndex`,
  *                         we only aggregate the portion of the parser msg
  *                         that takes place after `traceIndex`
  * @param failureStack     The stack of named `P(...)` parsers in effect when
  *                         the failure occured; only constructed when tracing
  *                         is enabled via `traceIndex != -1`
  * @param isSuccess        Whether or not the parse is currently successful
  * @param logDepth         How many nested `.log` calls are currently surrounding us.
  *                         Used to nicely indent the log output so you can see which
  *                         parsers are nested within which other parsers; -1 means
  *                         logging is disabled
  * @param index            The current index of the parse
  * @param cut              Has the current parse been prevented from backtracking?
  *                         This field starts as `true` at top-level, since there
  *                         is nowhere to backtrack to. Upon entering a parser
  *                         that can backtrack, such as `|` or `.?` or `.rep`,
  *                         it is set to `false`, and re-set to `true` upon
  *                         encountering a `./` or `~/` cut operator that prevents
  *                         backtracking.
  * @param successValue     The currently returned success value
  * @param verboseFailures  Whether or not we are currently collecting [[lastFailureMsg]]s;
  *                         defaults to false, unless
  *                         [[traceIndex]] is set OR we are inside a [[LogByNameOps.log]]
  *                         call which necessitates tracing in order to print out
  *                         failure traces during logging
  * @param noDropBuffer     Flag that prevents the parser from dropping earlier
  *                         input. Used for the `.!` capture operator that needs
  *                         the input around to return as a string, the `NoCut`
  *                         operator that forces backtracking (regardless of
  *                         internal cuts), or whitespace consumption which
  *                         implicitly backtracks if the parser on the RHS of
  *                         the whitespace fails or consumes 0 characters. The
  *                         value for this field is lexically scoped, but it is
  *                         up to the individual parser method implementations
  *                         to set the values and remember to un-set it to
  *                         the previous value after they finish. Forgetting to
  *                         re-set it to the previous value can cause strange
  *                         behavior or crashes.
  * @param misc             Additional key-value metadata that a user can attach
  *                         to a parsing run, and manage however they like. Not
  *                         as high performance as the built-in fields of
  *                         [[ParsingRun]], but perhaps sufficient to satisfy
  *                         ad-hoc needs e.g. keeping track of indentation or
  *                         other contextual information

  // HOW ERROR AGGREGATION WORKS:
  //
  // Fastparse provides two levels of error aggregation that get enabled when
  // calling `.trace()`: `failureTerminalAggregate`, and `failureGroupAggregate`:
  //
  // - `failureTerminalAggregate` lists all low-level terminal parsers which are
  //   tried at the given `traceIndex`. This is useful to answer the question
  //   "what can I put at the error position to make my parse continue"
  //
  // - `failureGroupAggregate` lists all high-level parsers which are tried at
  //   the given `traceIndex`. This is useful to answer the question "What was
  //   the parser trying to do when it failed"
  //
  // The implementation of `failureTerminalAggregate` is straightforward: we
  // simply call `aggregateTerminal` in every terminal parser, which collects
  // all the messages in a big list and returns it. The implementation of
  // `failureGroupAggregate` is more interesting, since we need to figure out
  // what are the "high level" parsers that we need to list. We use the
  // following algorithm:
  //
  // - When a parse which started at the given `traceIndex` fails without a cut
  //   - Over-write `failureGroupAggregate` with it's `shortParserMsg`
  //
  // - Otherwise:
  //   - If we are a terminal parser, we set our `failureGroupAggregate` to Nil
  //   - If we are a compound parser, we simply sum up the `failureGroupAggregate`
  //     of all our constituent parts
  //
  // The point of this heuristic is to provide the highest-level parsers which
  // failed at the `traceIndex`, but are not already part of the `failureStack`.
  // non-highest-level parsers do successfully write their message to
  // `failureGroupAggregate`, but they are subsequently over-written by the higher
  // level parsers, until it reaches the point where `cut == true`, indicating
  // that any further higher-level parsers will be in `failureStack` and using
  // their message to stomp over the existing parse-failure-messages in
  // `failureGroupAggregate` would be wasteful.
  //
  // These is an edge case where there is no given failure that occurs exactly at
  // `traceIndex` e.g. parsing "ax" with P( ("a" ~ "b") ~ "c" | "a" ~/ "d" ), the
  // final failure `index` and thus `traceIndex` is at offset 1, and we would like
  // to receive the aggregation ("b" | "d"). But ("a" ~ "b")
  // passes from offsets 0-2, "c" fails at offset 2 and ("a" ~ "b") ~ "c" fails
  // from offset 0-2. In such a case, we truncate the `shortParserMsg` at
  // `traceIndex` to only include the portion we're interested in (which directly
  // follows the failure). This then gets aggregated nicely to form the error
  // message from-point-of-failure.
  //
  // A follow-on edge case is parsing "ax" with
  //
  // val inner = P( "a" ~ "b" )
  // P( inner ~ "c" | "a" ~/ "d" )
  //
  // Here, we find that the `inner` parser starts before the `traceIndex` and
  // fails at `traceIndex`, but we want our aggregation to continue being
  // ("b" | "d"), rather than (inner | "d"). Thus, for opaque compound parsers
  // like `inner` which do not expose their internals, we use the `forceAggregate`
  // to force it to expose it's internals when it's range covers the `traceIndex`
  // but it isn't an exact match
